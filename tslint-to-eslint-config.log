6 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * arrow-body-style:
    - ESLint will throw an error if the function body is multiline yet has a one-line return on it.
  * no-invalid-this:
    - Functions in methods will no longer be ignored.
  * @typescript-eslint/quotes:
    - Option "jsx-single" is not supported by ESLint.
  * no-underscore-dangle:
    - Leading and trailing underscores (_) on identifiers will now be ignored.
  * @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions:
    - The TSLint optional config "allow-new" is the default ESLint behavior and will no longer be ignored.
  * prefer-arrow/prefer-arrow-functions:
    - ESLint does not support allowing standalone function declarations.
    - ESLint does not support allowing named functions defined with the function keyword.

3 rules are not known by tslint-to-eslint-config to have ESLint equivalents:
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "match-default-export-name".
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "number-literal-format".
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "whitespace".
